[00:14.00] It's not fair
[00:18.57] It's not fair
[00:23.15] It's not fair
[00:27.82] It's not fair
[00:29.30] I don't wanna have to wake up from this dream
[00:51.80] 
[00:32.25] When you hold me, cozy
[00:35.61] It sweetens up my life with such bliss
[00:41.47] When you warm me rosy
[00:44.71] It's like my heart is gently sun-kissed
[01:04.21] 
[00:49.36] You're the one
[00:52.28] The setting sun I'll long for, 'til kingdom come
[00:59.89] Please don't leave me lonely
[01:03.07] Please don't just fade away with my stolen heart
[01:27.07] 
[01:09.40] You change like the seasons
[01:12.54] But you always feel like home somehow
[01:18.41] Your every touch deepens
[01:21.91] The void in my heart that's missing you
[01:41.41] 
[01:29.38] It's no fair
[01:31.20] I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream
[01:38.45] It's no fair
[01:40.25] I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream
[02:14.25] 
[01:47.65] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[01:49.85] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[01:52.18] Should've taken home more than a bittersweet memory
[01:56.62] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[01:59.02] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[02:01.23] Will you sing along to all my bittersweet melodies?
[02:26.73] 
[02:24.08] No, I still can't seem to
[02:27.43] Sing more than blues when it's time for my verse
[02:33.00] It's true that I need you
[02:36.72] To turn my blues into bursting fireworks
[02:56.72] 
[02:41.43] You're the one
[02:44.18] The setting sun I'll long for, 'til kingdom come
[02:51.67] I'm wishing I could speed through
[02:55.05] All of the days that we have to be apart
[03:15.05] 
[03:00.49] You fade like (fade like)
[03:04.33] Like the sunset (sunset)
[03:09.17] Yet you stay light (stay light)
[03:13.76] Like the sunset (sunset)
[03:25.76] 
[03:17.65] I'm amazed how you change like the seasons
[03:22.93] But you always feel like home somehow
[03:28.75] Your every touch deepens
[03:32.14] The void in my heart that's missing you
[03:51.64] 
[03:37.20] It's no fair
[03:39.06] I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream
[03:46.47] It's no fair
[03:48.21] I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream
[04:22.21] 
[03:55.78] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[03:58.15] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[04:00.01] Should've taken home more than a bittersweet memory
[04:04.83] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[04:07.21] Anywhere I go, I'll miss you
[04:09.27] Will you sing along to all my bittersweet melodies?
[04:34.77] 
[04:17.69] Ooh-ooh
[04:21.99] The daydream, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
